# Timeline App

## Stage 3: Interactivity with Vanilla JavaScript

This stage builds on the HTML and CSS from the previous stages by adding interactivity and dynamic content loading using vanilla JavaScript.

### Features & Functionality Goals
- **Data Fetching** from `data/events.json` containing at least 8 sample events (year, title, description, imageURL, category).
- **Dynamic Rendering** of event markers into the `#timeline` section.
- **Interactive Modal** that opens when an event is clicked, showing full details.
- **Close Functionality** for the modal (click close button or outside the modal).
- **Background Scroll Lock** to prevent scrolling when the modal is open.
- **Script Placement** ensuring `script.js` is loaded at the end of the `<body>` for better performance.
