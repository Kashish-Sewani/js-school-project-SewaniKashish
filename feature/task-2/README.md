# Timeline App

## Stage 2: CSS and Preprocessors

This stage builds on the HTML skeleton from Task 1 by applying modern CSS techniques to create a polished, responsive timeline interface.

### Features & Styling Goals
- **Responsive Layout** using CSS Grid for the timeline structure.
- **Header Styling** with typography, color scheme, and spacing.
- **Navigation Styling** for filter placeholders.
- **Timeline Events** styled with markers (dots).
- **Modal Base Styles** (hidden by default, ready for JS interactivity later).
